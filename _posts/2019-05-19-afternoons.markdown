Do you ever see yourself as being something more than what you are?

Giving yourself away to something that is more than just one person. I have a dream of creating a world more than myself.

When I was younger I did not have freedom to hang out with my friends. My parents and I had moved across the world to have a better life but this meant that a lot more unknowns to our universe. Being great parents, my mom and dad had strict rules of coming home directly afterschool. Unable to hangout with many of my clasmates made it difficult to becoming friends in the real sense of the word. My classmates were all drones who shared classwork with me and I could sometimes get the homework from. My afternoons were dull with only homework and the occassional tv, the PBSkids stuff. 

And then the internet got me. Not the sound of the dialup or the "you got mail" welcoming you to the web. It was AIM. Instant messaging that connected you to classmates without taking up the phone. Being perfectly honest, the computer my parents bought remained unuse for years until I discovered instant messaging. Suddenly my afternoons were filled with more than homework. It was music from bands I've never heard or videos from shows I've never seen. It became gossip and jokes and everything inbetween. I was introduced to games were I would spend hours grinding levels or what seemed like days in a fantasy world under a night sky before raiding a dunegon. 

I loved the escape, and felt more connected with friend than ever before. Being connected  and sharing experiences together is why I would love to code. I want to bring others together. It could be through a simple message or  a virtual world where your biggest realworld problems become dust before an overlord. I would love to connect others and make afternoons filled with memoried.
